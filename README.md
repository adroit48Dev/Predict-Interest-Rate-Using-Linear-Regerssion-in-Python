 # Predict Interest Rate Charged on loans Using Linear Regerssion

We're going to use Lending Data Set to build a **Linear Regression** model and explore how the interest rate \
charged on loans may depend on the various factors. The aim is gain some insights into what might be useful \
in creating a linear regression model, and to separate out **"the noise".**

We follow these steps:

1.	Browse the data
2.	Data cleanup
3.	Data preprocessing
4.	Visual exploration
5.	Models derivation
6.	Models comparison
7.	Model accuracy
